# My first try on React

This is my first try to make something on React that works. It's simple todo list where u can add a task, delete and mark it as completed. Default tasks load from JSON PlaceHolder with GET method with setTimeOut and lazy loading.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
